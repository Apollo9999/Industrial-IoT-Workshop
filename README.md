# Intel Industrial IoT Workshop Setup Guide
This guide will walk you through the hardware and software setup for this workshop.

Intel offers scalable hardware solutions at different power, performance and price points. During these labs we will be using two different products that have Intel hardware.

## Up<sup>2</sup> Board
First is the [Up<sup>2</sup> Board](http://www.up-board.org/upsquared/). It features a 40 Pin I/O connector, multiple USB 3.0 ports, double Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and more other features make it a perfect solution for different domains and products like Robotics, Drone, Machine Vision, Smart Home, Education, Digital Signage, Intelligent Cars, Internet Of Things. The compatibility with Linux, Android, and all the Windows 10 distributions give you great flexibility, scalability and quick time to market.
